# Site index · format 2
Structure and the names of what each page offers. Values that change often — prices, hours, phone,
address — and body copy are deliberately not recorded here; read the page itself for those.

Design system: clinical-warm (stylesheet `assets/site.css`; `assets/styles.css` imports it).
